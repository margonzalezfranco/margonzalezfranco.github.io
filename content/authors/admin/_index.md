Dr. Mar Gonzalez-Franco is a Researcher in the EPIC (Extended Perception Interaction and Cognition) team at Microsoft Research. In her research Mar focuses on exploring human behavior and perception to help build better technologies on the wild. A part of her prolific scientific output, her work has also transferred to products used in daily basis by many around the world, such as Together mode in Microsoft Teams and [Microsoft Soundscape](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/soundscape/). As well as released multiple tools and open source libraries such as the [Microsoft Rocketbox](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-rocketbox-avatar-library-now-available-for-research-and-academic-use/) avatars, or the [MoveBox ](https://github.com/microsoft/MoveBox-for-Microsoft-Rocketbox/)toolkit to democratize avatar animation.

Mar holds a BSc in Computer Science (URL, Barcelona) and MSc in Biomedical Engineering (Universitat de Barcelona and Tsinghua University). She earned her Ph.D. in Immersive Virtual Reality and Clinical Psychology under the supervision of Prof. Mel Slater at the [EVENT-Lab](http://event-lab.org/), affiliated as a visiting student at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://medialab.mit.edu),  MediaLab. She completed her postdoctoral studies at University College London.

**Research**

 During my PhD I produced anarchic hand experiences into healthy humans (<a href="//www.researchgate.net/profile/Antoni_Rodriguez-Fornells/publication/281142098_Violating_body_movement_semantics_Neural_signatures_of_self-generated_and_external-generated_errors/links/55fff82808aeba1d9f841e67.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>), as well as stabbed their virtual hands (<a href="//s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42476775/A_threat_to_a_virtual_hand_elicits_motor20160209-26377-1azamx2.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1467853258&amp;Signature=Aga5bNZf8MmCVtAGe1pKUjuiX48%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_threat_to_a_virtual_hand_elicits_motor.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>). Altogether to explore how our brain perceives our body and search the underlying mechanisms that determine what is real and what is not. Technologically I was using real-time computer graphics, HMDs and body tracking systems.

Over the years my work has evolved in three ways&gt; (1) to continue exploring the wonders of VR and spatial computing; (2) to create new devices and explore what these technologies do to our perceptual systems, most prominent is my work exploring new haptic devices and spatial audio; and (3) to understand how do people behave at large when presented with technology. In that context I have an on-going collaboration with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/soundscape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soundscape</a> Team, and I did a post-doc at the University College London’s Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics (UCL-VECG) group where I explored obedience to authority paradigms, and whether people would electroshock an avatar (<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/would-you-give-a-virtual-electric-shock-to-an-avatar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientific American</a>).

My interest on impacting larger audiences made me pivot from academia into industrial laboratories and after having been at the MIT, Tsinghua, UB and UCL; I created and led an immersive tech lab at Airbus Group; joined the Startup Traity working on the creation of reputation standards for a user base of 4.5M. And since 2016 I am with Microsoft Research.

Despite the shift into industry, I am still deeply involved in the scientific community, where I often act as expert advisor to governments (US NSF, Canada NSERC, European Commission). As well as published, served as program committee, chair, and reviewed in multiple venues (IEEE &amp; ACM conferences and transactions, Nature Publishing group, Science Robotics). I am also very keen at disseminating my views on how technological companies and industrial labs should run. As well as the implications of technologies for the general public. In that role I have been invited to write several commentaries on my work for Scientific American and done keynotes and interviews with multiple Media outside of the VR world (<a href="https://vimeo.com/341644703" target="_blank" >Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiBegt6K3X0" target="_blank" >GEN summit</a>). Which also gained me some awards as junior technology leader to follow (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.es/23-jovenes-espanoles-35-anos-liderar-revolucion-tecnologica-millennials-373531" target="_blank" >Business Insider ES</a> 2019, <a href="https://www.mujeresaseguir.com/ganadoras" target="_blank">MAS Technology Award</a> <a href="https://www.mujerhoy.com/vivir/protagonistas/202103/06/cientificas-espanolas-logros-exito-futuro-nuevas-generaciones-solucion-pandemia-problemas-20210305111632.html" target="_blank">2019 and Next Generation Scientist</a>). Since 2020 I am also the Ethics and Diversity Chair of IEEE VGTC.
